# raspberry-control-led
This repository provide script for controlling LED through Raspberry Pi based on service oriented.
This article explain about web application using HTML and PHP for control (turn on or turn off) LED that connected through Raspberry Pi 2 Model B. For making this apps, needed some parts :
  1.	Computer/Laptop as a server
  2.	Raspberry Pi 2 Model B
  3.	Mini Breadboard
  4.	LED (3)
  5.	Resistor 270 Ohm (3)
  6.	Jumper Cable (Female-to-Male) 
  7.	Network Cable(UTP) .
  8.	Power Cable for Raspberry 5v 2A.
  9.	Access Point/Router Mikrotik.
Before assemble that parts, we have to understand about pin and GPIO of Raspberry Pi 2 Model B. 
Sebelum merangkai komponen tersebut, harus dipahami arsitektur pin dari GPIO Raspberry Pi 2 Model B. Here is the architecture of pin and GPIO of Raspberry Pi 2 Model B.
